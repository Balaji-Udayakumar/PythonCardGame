    "1. The function play_game takes two arguments, player1_hand and player2_hand, which represent the initial hands of Player 1 and Player 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two variables, player1_exhausted and player2_exhausted, are used to track whether each player has run out of cards (exhausted) during the game in a tie. They are initially set to 0, indicating that both players have cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A variable rounds is used to keep track of the number of rounds played in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The main game loop runs as long as the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The number of rounds is less than 50.\n",
    "    - Neither player has exhausted their cards during a tie (both player1_exhausted and player2_exhausted should be 0).\n",
    "    - Both players have at least two cards in their hands.\n",
    "5. Inside the loop, the code simulates a single round of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It calculates the scores for both players in the current round based on the values of the first two cards in their hands.\n",
    "    - It creates transfer sets (player1_transfer_set and player2_transfer_set) to hold the cards that will be transferred to the losing player in case of a tie.\n",
    "    - It prints the cards played by both players and their scores for the current round.\n",
    "    - It removes the first two cards from both players' hands.\n",
    "    - It initializes the add_cards variable to 4, representing the number of cards to be added to the losing player's hand.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. After calculating the scores for the current round, the code enters a nested loop to handle tie rounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the scores of both players are equal and neither player has exhausted their cards, it's a tie.\n",
    "    - The code continues drawing two cards from each player's hand and adding them to the tie round until one of the following conditions is met:\n",
    "        - One player's hand is exhausted (either player1_exhausted or player2_exhausted becomes 1).\n",
    "        - The scores are no longer tied.\n",
    "    - During each iteration of the tie round, the code updates the round scores and transfer sets accordingly.\n",
    "7. After exiting the tie round, the code checks whether any player's hand was exhausted during the tie round and, if so, returns the held cards to their original owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Further the code determines the winner of the round based on the scores. The losing player adds all the cards from the transfer sets (player1_transfer_set and player2_transfer_set) to their hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The code checks again if any player's hand has become exhausted after adding the transfer sets and updates the player1_exhausted and player2_exhausted flags accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The round counter is incremented, and the loop proceeds to the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. After exiting the loop, the code calculates the total scores for both players based on their remaining cards in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the code determines and prints the result of the game, including which player wins or if it's a tie."

This suggests starting with more points is correlated with a higher chance of losing the game."
